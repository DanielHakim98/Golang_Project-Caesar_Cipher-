# Golang_Project-Caesar_Cipher
* Because I am paid to write in Golang at my job, I am doing the tradition of starting a new project with Caesar Cipher. Just for work (and also for learning!)
* It's been fifth time I'm writing code for Caesar Cipher project and it's also the second time writing it in a compiled language.
* Nothing much different from Caesar Cipher project in my previous project but I think there's better way to convert from bytes to integer (or directly manipulate byte to increment the byte by shift number). Need more exploration on this.
